# PathAI.IATDA
PathAI.IATDA is an AI-powered delivery route optimization system designed to simulate and improve urban delivery logistics. The project combines clustering, graph algorithms, and visualization to help delivery drivers or services find the most efficient routes.

Key Features:

Delivery Simulation: Generates multiple delivery points across a city (e.g., San Francisco) to mimic real-world delivery scenarios.

AI Clustering: Uses K-Means to intelligently batch deliveries into manageable groups (e.g., 10 orders per batch).

Route Optimization: Applies Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute the shortest paths between deliveries within each batch.

Visual Analytics: Displays delivery clusters, optimized routes, and comparisons between unoptimized and optimized paths.

Scalable Architecture: Designed to integrate with real street data (OpenStreetMap) and can be extended with web interfaces or reinforcement learning for dynamic traffic adaptation.
